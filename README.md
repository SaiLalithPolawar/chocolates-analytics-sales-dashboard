# chocolates-sales-analysis-dashboard

## Case Description
This project involves the creation of a PowerBI sales report using the "awesome chocolates" dataset obtained from [here](https://chandoo.org/wp/learn-sql-for-data-analysis/). The dataset consists of information related to sales, products, geography, and salespeople, stored in a MySQL database. The objective is to analyze overall sales data, based on product and generate insightful dashboards to facilitate decision-making for the chocolate business.

## Project Requirement 
The project requires the following components:

- Access to the "awesome chocolates" dataset [here](https://chandoo.org/wp/learn-sql-for-data-analysis/).
- MySQL tools for managing and querying the dataset.
- PowerBI for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Knowledge of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated measures.
- SQL querying skills to extract specific data from the dataset.
- Understanding of parameters and data loading techniques in PowerBI.

## Project Files
The project consists of the following files:

- Sales Report.pbix: PowerBI file containing the sales report dashboard and visualizations.
